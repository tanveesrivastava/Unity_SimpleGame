# Unity_SimpleGame
The aim of this experiment is to develop a basic 3D interactive environment where a spherical or cylindrical object can move, jump, collide with other objects, and interact with elements like planes and cubes. The object should also change color upon reaching different levels and have the ability to shoot at cubes.

# 3D Object Interaction Experiment

## Features
- **Object Movement**: Control the object using `WASD` keys.
- **Jump Mechanic**: Press `Space` to jump onto different levels.
- **Collision Detection**: Proper physics-based collision handling.
- **Dynamic Color Change**: Object changes color upon level progression.
- **Shooting Mechanic**: Use the mouse to shoot cubes on each level.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity Engine
- **Programming Language**: C# (Unity) 
- **Physics Engine**: Built-in physics for movement, jumping, and collision
- **Rendering**: Real-time color changes on object transition
